# SamvidAI — Legal Intelligence, Not Legal Automation

## What is SamvidAI?
SamvidAI is a layout-aware, multimodal AI system designed to help lawyers
analyze long, complex contracts efficiently and safely.

## The Problem
Legal contracts are long, visual, and risk-sensitive.
Traditional OCR + NLP systems lose structure and context.

## The Solution
SamvidAI uses OpticalRAG — a vision-first retrieval architecture that
preserves layout and retrieves only relevant contract regions.

## Who is it for?
- Law firms
- In-house legal teams
- Compliance professionals

## What it does
- Clause-level retrieval
- Risk flagging
- Smart summaries
- Human-in-the-loop validation

## Philosophy
We do not replace attorneys. We empower them.

## Status
Currently in research and prototyping phase.
